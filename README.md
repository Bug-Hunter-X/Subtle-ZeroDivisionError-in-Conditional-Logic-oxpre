This repository demonstrates a subtle error related to zero division in Python. The `bug.py` file contains a function with flawed logic that doesn't handle the case where both inputs are 0 correctly. The solution, found in `bugSolution.py`, corrects this by restructuring the conditional statements. This example highlights the importance of comprehensive error handling, especially in functions with multiple conditional paths.
